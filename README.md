# Order Food Online - Full Stack WebApp 
Welcome to my Order Food Online Website! This is a full-stack web application built using PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to browse and order food from different restaurants, manage their account, and track their order status. The website features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for customers to navigate and place their orders.

I have put a lot of effort into developing this application, focusing on creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience. I have implemented various features such as a search bar, filtering options, and a cart system to help customers find and order their favorite dishes quickly and easily.

The application is also highly secure, with all sensitive user information being encrypted and stored in a secure database. Additionally, I have implemented a robust authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access their account information.

I hope that you enjoy using my Order Food Online Website and find it to be a convenient and efficient way to order food online. Feel free to reach out to me with any feedback or suggestions, as I am always looking for ways to improve the application.
